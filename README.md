This is the JavaScript notifier for capturing errors in web browsers and reporting them to [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io).

## Installation

Using yarn:

```sh
yarn add airbrake-js
yarn add cross-fetch # add cross-fetch as peerDependency
```

or Using npm:

```sh
npm install airbrake-js
npm install cross-fetch # add cross-fetch as peerDependency
```

## Setup

Example configurations can be found in [examples](examples), including:

* [Angular](examples/angular)
* [Angular 2](examples/angular-2)
* [Bower](examples/bower-wiredep)
* [Browserify](examples/browserify)
* [Express.js](examples/express)
* [hapi.js](examples/hapi)
* [Legacy](examples/legacy)
* [Node.js](examples/nodejs)
* [Rails](examples/rails)
* [React](examples/react)
* [Redux](examples/redux)
* [RequireJS](examples/requirejs)
* [Vue.js](examples/vuejs)

The notifier is built using
[umd](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/output/#output-librarytarget)
and therefore can be imported with AMD, CommonJS2 or as property in root.

If you prefer not to host the library yourself,
airbrake-js is available on the excellent
[cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/airbrake-js).

If you're using Webpack in browser context you might need to mark certain [Node.js packages](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-js/blob/83197fa170c1456bbcdcb48ca67a68d7a829865a/webpack.config.js#L32-L39) as [external dependencies](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/) to decrease bundle size.

## Basic Usage

First you need to initialize the notifier with the project id and API key taken from [Airbrake.io](https://airbrake.io):

```js
var airbrake = new airbrakeJs.Client({
  projectId: 1,
  projectKey: 'REPLACE_ME',
  environment: 'production',
});
```

Or if you are using browserify/webpack/etc:

```js
var AirbrakeClient = require('airbrake-js');
var airbrake = new AirbrakeClient({...});
```

Then you can send a textual message to Airbrake:

```js
var promise = airbrake.notify(`user id=${user_id} not found`);
promise.then(function(notice) {
  if (notice.id) {
    console.log('notice id', notice.id);
  } else {
    console.log('notify failed', notice.error);
  }
});
```

Or report catched errors directly:

```js
try {
  // This will throw if the document has no head tag
  document.head.insertBefore(document.createElement('style'));
} catch(err) {
  airbrake.notify(err);
  throw err;
}
```

Alternatively, you can wrap any code which may throw errors using the client's `wrap` method:

```js
var startApp = function() {
  // This will throw if the document has no head tag.
  document.head.insertBefore(document.createElement('style'));
}
startApp = airbrake.wrap(startApp);

// Any exceptions thrown in startApp will be reported to Airbrake.
startApp();
```

or use `call` shortcut:

```js
var startApp = function() {
  // This will throw if the document has no head tag.
  document.head.insertBefore(document.createElement('style'));
}

airbrake.call(startApp);
```

## Advanced Usage

### Notice Annotations

It's possible to annotate error notices with all sorts of useful information at the time they're captured by supplying it in the object being reported.

```js
try {
  startApp();
} catch (err) {
  airbrake.notify({
    error:       err,
    context:     { component: 'bootstrap' },
    environment: { env1: 'value' },
    params:      { param1: 'value' },
    session:     { session1: 'value' },
  });
  throw err;
}
```

### Severity

[Severity](https://airbrake.io/docs/airbrake-faq/what-is-severity/) allows categorizing how severe an error is. By default, it's set to `error`. To redefine severity, simply overwrite `context/severity` of a notice object. For example:

```js
airbrake.notify({
  error: err,
  context: { severity: 'warning' }
});
```

### Filtering errors

There may be some errors thrown in your application that you're not interested in sending to Airbrake, such as errors thrown by 3rd-party libraries, or by browser extensions run by your users.

The Airbrake notifier makes it simple to ignore this chaff while still processing legitimate errors. Add filters to the notifier by providing filter functions to `addFilter`.

`addFilter` accepts the entire [error notice](https://airbrake.io/docs/api/#create-notice-v3) to be sent to Airbrake, and provides access to the `context`, `environment`, `params`, and `session` values submitted with the notice, as well as the single-element `errors` array with its `backtrace` element and associated backtrace lines.

The return value of the filter function determines whether or not the error notice will be submitted.
  * If a null value is returned, the notice is ignored.
  * Otherwise, the returned notice will be submitted.

An error notice must pass all provided filters to be submitted.

In the following example all errors triggered by admins will be ignored:

```js
airbrake.addFilter(function(notice) {
  if (notice.params.admin) {
    // Ignore errors from admin sessions.
    return null;
  }
  return notice;
});
```

Filters can be also used to modify notice payload, e.g. to set the environment and application version:

```js
airbrake.addFilter(function(notice) {
  notice.context.environment = 'production';
  notice.context.version = '1.2.3';
  return notice;
});
```

### Filtering keys

With `keysBlacklist` option you can specify list of keys containing sensitive information that must be filtered out, e.g.:

```js
var airbrake = new AirbrakeClient({
    ...
    keysBlacklist: [
      'password', // exact match
      /secret/, // regexp match
    ],
});
```

### Source maps

Airbrake supports using private and public source maps. Check out our docs for more info:
- [Private source maps](https://airbrake.io/docs/features/private-sourcemaps/)
- [Public source maps](https://airbrake.io/docs/features/public-sourcemaps/)


### Unwrapping console

airbrake-js automatically wraps `console.log` function calls in order to collect logs and send them with first error. You can undo it using `unwrapConsole` option:

```js
var airbrake = new airbrakeJs.Client({
  ...
  unwrapConsole: true,
});
```

### Node.js request and proxy

In order to configure [request](https://github.com/request/request) HTTP client you can pass `request` option which accepts request wrapper:

```js
var airbrake = new AirbrakeClient({
  ...
  request: request.defaults({'proxy':'http://localproxy.com'})
});
```

### Client request proxy

In order restriction to not propagate API key there is possibility to setup server endpoints, which should proxy calls to the Airbrake service.
```js
var airbrake = new AirbrakeClient({
  apiProxy: {
    notifications: 'https://yourhost.com/api/v1/airbrake/notifications',
    routesStats: 'https://yourhost.com/api/v1/airbrake/route-stats',
  }
});
```
`AirbrakeClient.apiPaths` contains API urls with placeholders, which should be implemented on the server in order to proxy client library messages to the Airbrake service.

`AirbrakeClient.defaultHost` contains Airbrake API host, which will be used in url by default

Example: `AirbrakeClient.apiPaths.notices` contains `{host}/api/v3/projects/{projectId}/notices?key={projectKey}`, where `{host}` placeholder should be replaced with `https://api.airbrake.io` (AirbrakeClient.defaultHost value) and `{projectId}`, `{projectKey}` with your project id and API key.

If you are going to use this client proxy paths be aware that in a case of library update you should check whether the Airbrake service API urls are the same (by checking AirbrakeClient.apiPaths properties values). If they were updated, then you should update in you server code too.

## Integration

### window.onerror

airbrake-js automatically setups `window.onerror` handler when script is loaded. It also makes sure to call old error handler if there are any. Errors reported by `window.onerror` can be ignored using `ignoreWindowError` option:

```js
var airbrake = new airbrakeJs.Client({ignoreWindowError: true});
```

## What does "Script error" mean?
