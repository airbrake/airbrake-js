TraceKit - Cross browser stack traces.
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/occ/TraceKit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/occ/TraceKit)

### Supports all major browsers, from IE6 to Opera, the Andriod webiew and everywhere in between.

Not all browsers support stack traces on error objects, but TraceKit squeezes
out as much useful information as possible and normalizes it. 3kB minified + gzipped


## Install

```
bower install tracekit
```
This places TraceKit at `components/tracekit/tracekit.js`. Install [bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/): `npm install bower -g`, download npm with Node: http://nodejs.org

Then include the `<script>` to your page

## Usage

First, register a subscriber for error reports:
```javascript
TraceKit.report.subscribe(function yourLogger(errorReport) {
  //send via ajax to server, or use console.error in development
  //to get you started see: https://gist.github.com/4491219
});
```

Then, make sure all your code is in a try/catch block:
```javascript
try {
  /*
   * your application code here
   *
   */
  throw new Error('oops');
} catch (e) {
  TraceKit.report(e); //error with stack trace gets normalized and sent to subscriber
}
```

In order to get stack traces, you need to wrap your code in a try/catch block like above. Otherwise the error hits `window.onerror` handler and will only contain the error message, line number, and column number.

You also need to throw errors with `throw new Error('foo')` instead of `throw 'foo'`.

You can unsubscribe some subscriber function by doing `TraceKit.report.unsubscribe(someFunction)`

#### Eliminating (anonymous function)'s

```javascript
Api.foo = function Api_foo() {
};
var bar = function barFn() { //'Fn' is to avoid errors in IE
};
```

We recommend the above convention of function naming, `Api_foo` always corresponds to `Api.foo`, `barFn` corresponds to `bar` - just as long as the function name is not the same as the identifier. Otherwise, you can have bugs in IE.

## Options

TraceKit will attempt to fetch an analyze source files, but you can turn this off using:

```javascript
TraceKit.remoteFetching = false;
```

You can also tell TraceKit to ignore global window errors with:

```javascript
TraceKit.collectWindowErrors = false;
```

## Contributing

Right now the project is being over-hauled, please jump into #shieldjs on freenode to discuss before submitting a big/medium PR (this saves us all time)

All code must pass JSHint and tests, run `grunt` for this. New features need accompanying documentation in the README, changes to existing api's need updated documentation. In general, open an issue for whatever it is you're thinking, get some quick feedback, make good stuff, and we'll accept the PR.
